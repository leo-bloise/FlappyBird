    Flappy Bird
</h1>

The game is not complete and it has a terrible performance, but I decided to stop improving it. I learned a lot from this project and I'll keep my path to learn more about development and games, in general.

Basically, it has all the functionality it needs:
- Collision detection (using binary search).
- Gravity.
- Animated Sprites.
- Sound effects.

Problems:
- Jittering and Lagging after some point.
- Concurrency problems.
