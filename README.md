    Flappy Bird
</h1>

The game isn't complete, but I've decided to stop improving this project to focus more on web related tech. I learned a lot from this project and I'll keep my path to learn more about development and games. 

Basically, it has all the functionality it needs:
- Collision detection (using binary search).
- Gravity.
- Animated Sprites.
- Sound effects.

Problems:
- Jittering and Lagging after some point.
- Concurrency problems.
